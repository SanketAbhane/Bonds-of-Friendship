In the tapestry of life, friendship weaves,
A bond of trust and support that never leaves.
Through laughter and tears, it stands strong,
A guiding light when things go wrong.

BEST FRIENDS

In laughter and tears, best friends stand strong,
Two souls united, where belonging belongs.
------------------

Shared secrets and memories we hold dear,
In the realm of friendship, hearts are near.

Best Friends Version 2
//Gorakshanath Poem
Through laughter and tears, you've been my guide,
In this friendship's embrace, forever we'll abide.
Side by side, hand in hand, we face life's bends,
Best friends forever, a love that never ends.
